BBM104 – Programming Assignment 4 (Tank 2025 – JavaFX Game)

In this assignment, a 2D tank game is developed using JavaFX in Java 8, focusing on event-driven programming and graphical user interface design. The player controls a tank that moves in four directions and fires bullets, while enemy tanks spawn, move randomly, and shoot at intervals. The game environment includes indestructible walls and collision detection.

The game features core mechanics such as scoring, three lives with respawn, pause menu, and a game over screen with restart and exit options. Bullet collisions trigger explosion effects, and the game state must be managed correctly across different modes (running, paused, game over).

This assignment highlights real-time programming concepts, object interaction, and visual feedback using JavaFX. The main learning objective is to build a complete interactive application with proper state management, clean code structure, and responsive user controls.
