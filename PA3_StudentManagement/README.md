BBM104 – Programming Assignment 3 (University Student Management System)

This assignment implements a comprehensive Student Management System in Java 8, using all four OOP pillars: inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. The system manages academic entities such as students, academic members, departments, programs, and courses, and establishes relationships like enrollments and teaching assignments.

Multiple input files are used to initialize the system, including people, departments, programs, courses, and grades. Based on this data, the system generates structured reports such as student reports (including GPA calculation) and course reports (including grade distributions and averages). All computations must follow the defined grading rules and produce outputs in exact format.

The project emphasizes correct modeling of complex relationships between entities, accurate statistical calculations, and robust error handling through exceptions. The goal is to simulate a real academic information system with clean architecture and consistent reporting.
